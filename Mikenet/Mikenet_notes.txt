To install Mikenet-v8.0 in linux machine:

1. Download *.tar.gz file from: http://cnbc.cmu.edu/~mharm/research/tools/mikenet/
2. unzip: 
	gunzip mikenet_v8.tar.gz
	tar xvf mikenet_v8.tar
3. set up environent file:
	in shrc shell: open/create .cshrc file, and put: 
		setenv MIKENET_DIR ${HOME}/Mikenet-v8.0
	in bash shell: open/create .bashrc file, and put:
		MIKENET_DIR=${HOME}/Mikenet-v8.0
		export MIKENET_DIR
	check whether the environment is set: ${HOME}
4. Make file:
	cd Mikenet-v8.0/src 
	make clean 
	make cc
5. Run an example: 
	cd Mikenet-v8.0/demos/xor
	rm xor
	make xor
	./xor
	Go to ~/mikenet/demos/tutorial and look at the code in the tutorial.c file
6. To build your own simulation, start with one of the existing demos (like xor), and copy all of the files into your own directory. Change xor.c and xor.ex as you see fit, and then do a "make" to build your simulation. You don't need to recompile the libraries, just your own simulation .c file(s) when you change things.
7. How to use different functions and examples: http://cnbc.cmu.edu/~mharm/research/tools/mikenet/	

To run an example of MikeNet:
Makefile format: (based on examples of benchmark)

#to use gcc, use these settings 

CC = ${MYCC}

DEBUG = ${MYDEBUG}

LINK_ARGS= 

####SPECIAL= -funroll-loops

SPECIAL=



# a generic c compiler setting

#CC = cc

#DEBUG= -O

#LINK_ARGS=  


### note: if mikenet is installed at the system level,

### (like, /usr/local/include, /usr/local/lib) then you don't need

### this gunk.  



LIBHOME=${MIKENET_DIR}/lib/${ARCH}/

INCLUDEHOME=${MIKENET_DIR}/include

# Notes:
CC, DEBUG, LINK_ARGS, SPECIAL: define the commands for compiling using gcc
LIBHOME and INCLUDEHOME: define the lib of Mikenet
all:  followed up exe file names
for each exe file, write the command to compile
benchit_v7:  benchit.c Makefile:   benchit.c is required code file, Makefile is added arbitrarily
gcc -o exename codename ${DEBUG} -I${INCLUDEHOME} directory of lib -lm: note that only ~/Mikenet-v8.0/lib/libmikenet.a works! the one in /i686/ does not!
clean: rm -f remove .o and exe files generated

# to compile, use:  make -f Makefile
# to clean, use:  make -f Makefile clean
